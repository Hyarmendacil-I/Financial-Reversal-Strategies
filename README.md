# BAIM-Financial-Analytics-Reversal-Strategies
Project for M.S. Business Analytics and Information Management course Portfolio Management. Tackling short-term reversals strategies, with both the CAPM and Fama French frameworks. Programming done in R, with use of Excel. 

This project was great experience in finance, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to learn how to apply analytical skills to markets.

Thanks for your consideration in viewing my project, I really appreciate you giving me a look.

Sincerely, Alex Baker. :)
